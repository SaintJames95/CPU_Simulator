-Need to forward TO ID (Branching), EX1 (Everything Else), and MEM (For storing)
-All instructions take 3 cycles of TIME, 
-but the cycles indicates when the data will be available for forwarding
-Instructions and data are stored in memory starting at address 0x0 and 0x100 respectively (Do not worry about this for now).
-Will need to parse once over for branching addresses
-An instruction only needs to know 
	1) what data it will need at ID, EX1, or MEM 
	and
	2) what data it will produce during EX and MEM. Also what stage (EX1, 2 or 3) it's data is available.
-Registers 0 - 31
